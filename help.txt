To use the bot address it directly using the "@" method

specify commands and sub-commands by including them in your message to the comboBot (order does not matter, the bot only checks that specfic phrases are included)

_Note: the asterisk denotes required commands_

*Commands:*

help - Outputs this help text...but you knew that

how many - counts how many successful or failed Windows loads there have been in a given time frame
>	Sub-Commands:
>		*successful/failed* * - determines whether you are going to count the successful or failed Windows loads
>		*since* - gives totals counted between the present and a given date* (required if using since) in mm/dd/yyyy format 
>		*between* - gives totals counted between two given dates* (beginning and end required if using between) in mm/dd/yyyy format with the start date first
>		*on* - gives totals counted on a given date* (required if using on)
>		_(Note: Slack API limits requests to 1000 messages, requests spanning long periods of time may give inaccurate counts due to this limitation)_
>	Default:
>		time frame for counted messages is the current date
